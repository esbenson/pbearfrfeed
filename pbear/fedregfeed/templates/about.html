    <h2>About: Polar Bears</h2>

    <p><a href="http://eol.org/pages/328580/overview" target="_blank"><em>Ursus maritimus</em></a>, the polar bear, has been the focus of international conservation efforts since the 1960s and in recent years has come to symbolize the threat of global climate change. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> took the historic step of listing the polar bear as "threatened" under the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/" target="_blank">Endangered Species Act of 1973</a> because of the likelihood that global warming would lead to shrinking habitats for the species -- specifically, less ice.</p>

    <p>One of the most immediate consequences of the ESA listing was the end of a program under which American sport-hunters had been allowed to import trophies of polar bears killed in Canada. Killing polar bears for sport and importing polar bear parts for personal use (e.g., as trophies) had been illegal in the United States since 1972, when the species was protected by the <a href="http://mmc.gov/legislation/mmpa.shtml" target="_blank">Marine Mammal Protection Act</a>, an important predecessor of the ESA. (Alaska Natives were still free to kill bears under certain conditions.)</P>
    
    <p>In Canada, however, where the majority of the world's polar bears reside, hunting had been regulated but legal. Amendments to the MMPA in 1994 made it possible for American hunters to bring back their Canadian trophies. Advocates of the measure argued that Canada's polar bear population was large and well-managed, and that license and guide fees would help support arctic communities and polar bear conservation.</p>

    <p>The 2008 "threatened" listing shut the door on trophy imports, including the import of parts from bears already killed by American hunters. Ever since, the <a href="http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/articles/index.cfm?action=view&amp;Article_ID=3292" target="_blank">Safari Club International</a>, the <a href="http://www.boone-crockett.org/about/positions_polarbear.asp?area=about&amp;ID=6B455080&amp;se=1&amp;te=1" target="_blank">Boone and Crockett Club</a>, the <a href="http://www.nrahuntersrights.org/Article.aspx?id=1682" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a>, and other hunting advocates have been trying to roll back the listing, or at least to allow trophies from animals that had been killed before the listing to be imported, while the <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/awetzler/polar_bear_trophy_hunters_in_t.html" target="_blank">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, the <a href="http://hsus.typepad.com/wayne/2011/10/polar-bear-protection.html" target="_blank">Humane Society of the United States</a>, and other environmental and animal welfare/rights groups have defended the ban on importation. Recent court decisions have supported the listing and the ban, but it's likely that the issue will continue to be controversial as long as trophy hunting of polar bears remains legal in Canada.</p>

    <p>The Polar Bear Feed takes advantage of recent developments in open government, particularly the development of a powerful and easy-to-use web service for the <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Register</a> that make it possible to quickly gather and analyze some of the crucial primary sources for the recent history of U.S. federal protections for polar bears: namely, all of the material about federal regulatory actions that has been published in the <em>Federal Register</em> since it first went electronic in 1994.</p>

    <h2>About: Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The Polar Bear Feed is a web application that constructs a local database by using the <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/blog/learn/developers" target="_blank">Federal Register Application Programming Interface (API)</a> to search for the terms "polar bear" or "polar bears" in the full text of notices, rules, and other items in the U.S. <em>Federal Register</em>. It downloads the results and makes them viewable as a browsable and searchable list, as an RSS feed, as a detail view of each item, and as dynamically generated charts and maps. The app checks the official <em>Federal Register</em> site for new items whenever the "home" page is requested.</P>
    <p>The Polar Bear Feed was written with the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> web application framework, which is based on the <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> language. Version control is managed with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Deployment is through <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, using <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" target="_blank">virtualenv</a> and <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip" target="_blank">pip</a> to establish the Django/Python environment, <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/" target="_blank">South</a> to handle database migrations, and git to push the code up to the Heroku servers. The database backend is <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgres</a> with the <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/" target="_blank">psycopg</a> Python adapter. Charts are generated using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/" target="_blank">Google Chart API</a>, with request URLs generated either manually or with the help of <a href="http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/" target="_blank">pygooglechart</a>. Some page-by-page caching is done with <a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank">memcached</a> as the backend for the Django caching framework. A tiny bit of client-side JavaScript with the <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> library is used to hide/show data on the visualization page. The local development platform is <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> Linux.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software" target="_blank">openness</a>, all of the (not always pretty) code for the Polar Bear Feed can be viewed and downloaded <a href="https://github.com/esbenson/pbearfrfeed" target="_blank">here</a>. If you're developing Federal Register apps with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, the FR2.0 team has made things easier by providing an API available as the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/federal_register" target="_blank">federal_register</a> gem.</p>
